Outcome: Student can implement an animation (finite) state machine.


1. Look at the "Animation State Machine.pdf" file to see the logic of the desired state machine.


2. In the Peon class, create property(ies) to track the player's state.


3. In the Peon.update() method, create a finite state machine with correct behavior and transitions. You do NOT need to use the state design pattern here. So don't create any new classes.
