Outcome: Student can accurately determine the current and previous state of the keyboard.


1. In the Game class, add property(ies) to track the state of the 'B' key.


2. In the Game constructor, add event listeners that listen for keyboard events.
3. In the gameLoop() method, use variables that track the state of the 'B' key to decide when to call shrink() and embiggen().


4. In the Game class, create event handler functions for the keyboard events.


5. In the newly created event handlers, DO NOT scale either the bubble1 or bubble2.


6. In the newly created event handlers, DO NOT call the embiggen() or shrink() methods.
