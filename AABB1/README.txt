Outcome: Student can implement AABB collision detection.


	1. In the AABB class, create property(ies) to store the 4 edges of the bounding box
	
2. In the AABB class, create property(ies) to store the size (or half-size) of the bounding box
	
3. In the AABB.setSize() method, store the size of the box

	4. In the AABB.calc() method, calculate the 4 edges of the box

	5. In the AABB.overlaps() method, return true if the boxes overlap, and return false if they do not
	
6. In the Art1 constructor, set the size of Art1's aabb

	7. In Art1's update method, update the aabb's edges

	8. In the Art2 constructor, set the size of Art2's aabb

	9. In Art2's update method, update the aabb's edges
